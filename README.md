Send stickers to other users!

You have to create an account to access the chat.

Once it's done, you can see your profile on the left and change or add information about you.
You can also see the profile of the other users on the right.

The most interesting part is obviously in the middle. On the top left, you have a "Contacts" nav. There, you will find the other users of the app. When you click on one of them, you will be able to chat with them thanks to the stickers that are available at the bottom (you have to click on one of the sticker pack in the nav to see them!)

Of course, we need at least 2 users to be able to use the application
